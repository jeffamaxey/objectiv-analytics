3rd party code and data
=======================

Some code distributed within the nb2plots sources was developed by other
projects. This code is distributed under their respective licenses that are
listed below.

Matplotlib plot extension
-------------------------

The ``nbplots`` module is an edited version of
``matplotlib/lib/matplotlib/sphinxext/plot_directive.py``.

Among the major changes are the following:

* rename of 'plot' directive to 'nbplot';
* rename of 'plot_*' configuration options to 'nbplot_*' equivalent;
* nbplot removes the option to point to Python script file rather than
  using the code in the directive;
* nbplot keeps the namespace across directives in the same page, by default;
* include-source is True by default;
* nbplot can include multiple "parts" that can be selected via the
  "render-parts" and "run-parts" options;
* do not use cached output when rebuilding page to avoid errors from stale
  output;
* fix bug including empty parens when ``nofigs`` not specified (also fixed
  upstream);
* empty ``setup_module`` to avoid breakage of nose doctests;
* fix of plot doctest.
